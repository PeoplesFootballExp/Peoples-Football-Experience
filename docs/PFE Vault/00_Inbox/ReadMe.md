### 🎯 Purpose

A **zero-friction space** to capture _everything_ that crosses your mind — ideas, references, sketches, random notes — before they’re sorted. Think of it as your “mental RAM.”

### 🧠 What Goes Here

- New feature ideas or design thoughts
- Questions or half-baked mechanics
- Notes from watching football or playing similar games
- Reference screenshots or inspirations
- Quick reminders (“test player stamina curve tomorrow”)

### 🔗 Connections

These notes will later move into:

- `02_Design` (if it’s a real feature or system)
- `01_Development` (if it’s about process or tools)
- `04_Wiki` (if it’s about the in-game world)
- `05_Tasks` (if it turns into something actionable)
- `06_Wiki` (if it correctly documents something about the in game world)

### 🧰 Best Practices

- Use **daily or weekly processing** sessions to sort and tag items.
- Keep it messy — that’s okay. The goal is _capture_, not organization.
- Add a tag immediately when possible (`#idea`, `#question`, etc.)

### 📝 Example Note

`# Idea – Wind Physics Tags: #idea #gameplay Would be cool if matches had wind that slightly changes ball trajectory. Maybe use perlin noise for direction variance. 
`→ Move to [[System – Match Environment]] later.`
