The ScratchPad is the section where any random ideas or notes can be placed. This section truly is the best place to be unorganized inside the (hopefully) organized Game Development Brain

Feel free to add any .md files to this folder that contain news ideas or even brainstorming sessions. The ScratchPad will be cleaned periodically so this folder will be a constantly changing folder that may be moved into the Queue (for more organized ideas and new additions to the rest of the organized brain). 

Have fun brainstorming!!! :)
