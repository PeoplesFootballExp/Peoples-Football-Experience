### 🎯 Purpose

To define your game’s **aesthetic identity** and **creative tone.**  
Not for storing actual media, but for documenting _how things should look, sound, and feel._

### 🧠 What Goes Here

- Visual style guides (UI, color palettes, logo design)
- Audio direction and soundtrack notes
- Concept art documentation
- Mood boards and references (linked images)
- Narrative tone / writing direction

### 🔗 Connections

- Influences `03_Guides` (presentation style)
- Draws from systems in `02_Design` (UI design, sound systems)
- Helps collaborators align on style

### 🧰 Best Practices

- Embed example images (`![[filename.png]]`)
- Keep color palettes or sound lists in Markdown tables
- Reference influences (games, leagues, real teams)
