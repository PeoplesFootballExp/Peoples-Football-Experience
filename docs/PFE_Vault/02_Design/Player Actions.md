# Actions

This document will detail the actions a player can take and what will determine its outcome.

# Match States

The match state system will dictate what the action will be. For example, a key may shoot when the player is in possession but then tackle when the player is not in possession. These match states will function as a Finite State Machine (FSM) where the current state dictates what the buttons/keys will do. Thankfully, in Godot button inputs can be generalize where a keyboard push can mean many things.

In general, we will keep the actions dependent on state.
