## Overview

This menu element will be used whenever the player wants to select a team. This includes international team or clubs teams. For the MVP, the player needs to only select a country to play as. For this, and even for later, the selection comes from a simple grid like selection.

## Order of Selection

1. Continental Confederation
2. Territory
3. Men or Women Teams
4. League in Pyramid
5. Team

To make things easier, the zero level league in EVERY country will be the national team. This way, when played select a league, they can start from the true league pyramid or choose level zero which is the national team of that country. 

So this workflow would look like the following examples
1. Nigeria's Mens National Team
	1. Select AFCON confederation
	2. Select Nigeria
	3. Select Men Teams
	4. Select Legue Level 0
	5. Select National Team
2. AC Milan Women's Team
	1. Select UEFA confederation
	2. Select Italy
	3. Select Women Teams
	4. Select League Level 1
	5. Select AC Milan

This flow allows selection of both all club teams, all national teams, and all men and women teams. Also allows for quicker selection as each level quickly zooms into the desired team. For example, having something similar to FIFA, where all the leagues are in one long line of options, would be unsustainable for this many countries. This set up quickly eliminates options as we go, making the final selection easier.
