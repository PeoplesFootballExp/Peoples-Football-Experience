### 🎯 Purpose

The **in-universe** section of your vault — everything that exists _inside_ the world of your football game.  
Even if your game is realistic, you’ll still have fictional leagues, teams, stadiums, and backstories.

### 🧠 What Goes Here

- World-building notes (countries, tournaments, histories)
- Team and club profiles
- Character/player bios
- Stadium and event descriptions
- In-game calendar, maps, or timelines

### 🔗 Connections

- Draws from procedural or narrative systems in `02_Design`
- Supports content for `03_Guides` (player-facing info)
- Can be auto-generated or edited via in-game modding later

### 🧰 Best Practices

- Use consistent naming: `Team – Coastal FC`, `Player – Diego Ramos`.
- Cross-link heavily (teams ↔ leagues, stadiums ↔ cities).
- Include real-world analogues or inspirations for reference.
