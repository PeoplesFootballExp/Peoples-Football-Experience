### 🎯 Purpose

To **teach** and **inform** — this is your documentation for players, testers, and collaborators.

Two major audiences:

1. **Players:** user guides, how-to-play, FAQs
2. **Team members:** development setup, collaboration practices, contribution guides

### 🧠 What Goes Here

- Player manuals and gameplay explanations
- Dev setup guides (installing Unity, configuring Git)
- Style guides (art, audio, writing)
- Modding instructions
- FAQ and troubleshooting

### 🔗 Connections

- References systems and features in `02_Design`
- Derived from internal docs in `01_Development`
- Shares in-game world info from `04_Wiki`

### 🧰 Best Practices

- Use simple, clear formatting for external docs.
- Separate **public-facing** guides (for release) from **team-facing** ones (for devs).
- You can export these to Markdown, PDF, or a website later.
