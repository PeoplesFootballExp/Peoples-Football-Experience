For the most part, since this project is open source and free, development will be mostly using free and open source tools as well. This can change in the future but for now this is the best course of actions for me. 

## **Documentation/Wiki:**

### Obsidian


![[Obsidian_Logo.png|125x125]]

Reasons:
- Free and Open Source
- Uses Markdown Files, making it flexible for normal text and for other programs that use Markdown such as Github 
- Tagging systems means it works great for complex interconnected wikis or documentation
- Bare Bones out of the box tool, but with a great plugin systems which expands usefulness

### Github Wikis

Reasons:
- Built into Github Repos by default, enables a nice and easy way to integrate this Obsidian Vault into the Github
- Does not automatically recognize the docs/ folder as the wiki, but can be pushed by a Github Actions after every push
- Allows easy viewing of information about the game by every user on Github


## Game Engine

### Godot
![[godot_logo-1.png|174x174]]


Reasons:
- Free and open source, continuing the community feel for PFE
- Lightweight Game Engine
- Supports Multiple Platforms such as Mac, Windows, Linux, Web, and Mobile
- Node system means its easy for beginners to learn
- GDScript language, good for fast prototyping before turning into Rust
- Growing Usage in Indie game scene and support

## Programming Languages

### Rust
![[rust_mascot.png|169x113]]
![[rust_programming_logo.png|150x150]]

Reasons:
- Robust Security in mind, less memory bugs or unsafe behavior long term\
- Typed language with blazingly fast speeds
- Safe parallel programming, with addition options of using GPU
- Verbose language with easy management system, `cargo`
- Great error messages, with catching most errors during complilation
- Open source and free to use

### GDScript

Reasons:
- Fast prototyping speeds
- Similar syntax as Python, easy for new programmers to learn
- Built specifically for the Godot Game Engine, almost anything can be done with it
- Great for simple UI mechanisms or add-ons
- Fast enough for simple games, improvements with using Rust after working prototype

### Python
![[python_logo.png|144x144]]
Reasons:
- Great for creating automated programs to collect data from online sources
- Easy and fast prototyping
- Most people know how to program simple python programs
- Extensive data libraries
- Integrates perfectly with SQL databases
- Useful for other meta tooling, outside of the Godot game and for users/players to potentially run themselves


## Art

### Krita

![[krita_logo.png|197x197]]

Reasons: 
- Easy program to begin drawing with
- Free and Open Source, following principles of project
- Great for quick sketches, ideas, or even simple UI design
- Useful for amazing art work by professionals

### Inkscape

![[inkscape_logo.png|159x159]]

Reasons:
- Useful for SVG images, that can scale without losing quality
- Useful to make logos, icons, or UI elements that need to scale to various sizes
- Free and Open source program, following principles of project


### Blender
![[blender_logo.png|200x163]]

Reasons:
- Free and Open Source 3D modeling program
- Useful for animations and creating good 3D models
- Directly exports to Godot neatly
- Creating full characters, landscapes, items, or art

### Aseprite

![[aseprite_logo.png|163x175]]

Reasons:
- Paid, but open source program 
- Useful for creating nice pixel art
- Useful for creating animated pixel art
- Useful for spritesheets creation

### Penpot

![[penpot_logo.png|173x173]]
Reasons:
- Useful for quick UI prototyping
- Scaling feature, useful for Mobile and Computer prototyping
- Free for personal use and open source
- Only browser option for now, but desktop app may be coming soon
## Affinity

![[affinity_logo.png|200x200]]
Reasons:
- Recently became a free software tool
- Useful for creating regular images and vector images all in one tool
- Soon to become widely used amongst professional designers

## Music

Not sure for now, but likely to use free and open source software like audacity


## Database Management

### SQLite
![[sqlite_logo.png|252x119]]
Reasons:
- Light weight database system supported across many platforms
- Relational Model Database
- ACID transactions are the default, allowing multi-threaded transactions
- Takes care of storage, memory optimizations, query system, and query optimizations
- Expandable to other non-local versions of SQL like MySQL or PostgresSQL
- Strongly tested and trusted code, used for years and likely to be supported till 2050
- Free to use and open source, following principles of game

### DB Browser

Reasons:
- Light weight application able to view, edit, and quickly prototype with SQLite databases
- Allows for testing of databases
- Multi database support
- Free

### SQLite Studio

Reasons:
- Light weight application able to view, edit, and quickly prototype with SQLite databases
- Allows for testing of databases
- Multi database support
- Free and Open Source

### Google Sheets
![[google_sheets_logo.png|183x183]]
Reasons:

- Allows for complex CSV files of data collections and analysis 
- Quick Prototyping of SQL like tables
- Automatically saved to the cloud and downloadable to offline use
- Shareable sheets, allows for collaboration with teams
- Con: Owned by Google, so access can be lost at any time

### LibreOffice
![[libre_office_logo.png|176x129]]
