For the most part, since this project is open source and free, development will be mostly using free and open source tools as well. This can change in the future but for now this is the best course of actions for me. 

## **Documentation/Wiki:**

### Obsidian


![[Obsidian_Logo.png|125x125]]

Reasons:
- Free and Open Source
- Uses Markdown Files, making it flexible for normal text and for other programs that use Markdown such as Github 
- Tagging systems means it works great for complex interconnected wikis or documentation
- Bare Bones out of the box tool, but with a great plugin systems which expands usefulness

### Github Wikis

Reasons:
- Built into Github Repos by default, enables a nice and easy way to integrate this Obsidian Vault into the Github
- Does not automatically recognize the docs/ folder as the wiki, but can be pushed by a Github Actions after every push
- Allows easy viewing of information about the game by every user on Github


## Game Engine

### Godot

- Free and open source, continuing the community feel for PFE
- Lightweight Game Engine
- Supports Multiple Platforms such as Mac, Windows, Linux, Web, and Mobile
- Node system means its easy for beginners to learn
- GDScript language, good for fast prototyping before turning into Rust
- Growing Usage in Indie game scene and support

## Programming Languages

### Rust

![[rust_programming_logo.png|150x150]]

Reasons:
- Robust Security in mind, less memory bugs or unsafe behavior long term\
- Typed language with blazingly fast speeds
- Safe parallel programming, with addition options of using GPU
- Verbose language with easy management system, `cargo`
- Great error messages, with catching most errors during complilation
- Open source and free to use

### GDScript

Reasons:
- Fast prototyping speeds
- Similar syntax as Python, easy for new programmers to learn
- Built specifically for the Godot Game Engine, almost anything can be done with it
- Great for simple UI mechanisms or add-ons
- Fast enough for simple games, improvements with using Rust after working prototype

## Art
