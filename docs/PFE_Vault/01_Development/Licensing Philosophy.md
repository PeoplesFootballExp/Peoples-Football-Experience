# People’s Football Experience — Licensing Philosophy

## Our Vision

People’s Football Experience (PFE) was created to be **free, inclusive, and community-driven**.  
We want anyone, anywhere, to be able to play, learn from, and contribute to the game — without barriers like ads, paywalls, or commercial exploitation.  

At the same time, we want to protect the **spirit of sharing**: ensuring that contributions remain available to the community and that derivatives continue to benefit everyone.  

Our licensing philosophy reflects these core values.

## How We License PFE

PFE is composed of three main parts, each licensed in a way that best protects its purpose:

| Component | License | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Code** | GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3) | Keeps the game’s software open-source. Any modifications or forks must also remain open and freely available. |
| **Assets** (art, music, sounds, models) | Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) | Ensures that all visual and audio assets remain free for non-commercial use while encouraging sharing, remixing, and adaptation. |
| **Documentation and Wiki** | Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0) | Allows anyone to freely share, translate, and adapt guides or documentation while ensuring credit and share-alike licensing. |

## Why We Made These Choices

### 1. Code: GPL v3
The GPL protects our game from being turned into proprietary software.  
- ✅ Anyone can use, modify, or distribute the code.  
- ✅ Anyone who distributes modifications must share the code under the same license.  
- 🚫 No one can “lock” the game’s code behind a paywall or closed license.  

This ensures that PFE remains **community-owned** and open for all.

### 2. Assets: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
We want our assets to be **freely available**, but we also want to prevent someone from taking our graphics, music, or models and **selling them for profit**.  
- ✅ Players and creators can remix or adapt the assets for **non-commercial purposes**.  
- ✅ Share-alike ensures that modifications remain available to the community.  

### 3. Documentation: CC BY-SA 4.0
Our guides, wiki, and documentation are meant to **educate and empower the community**.  
- ✅ Anyone can share, translate, or adapt the documentation — even commercially.  
- ✅ Share-alike ensures that improvements remain open.  

This approach fosters learning and collaboration without commercial restriction.

## Contributions to PFE

We welcome contributions from everyone — whether it’s code, art, music, or documentation.  

By contributing, you agree that your work will be licensed under the same terms as the corresponding part of the project.  

- 🧠 **Code → GPL v3**  
- 🎨 **Assets → CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**  
- 📚 **Documentation → CC BY-SA 4.0**  

This ensures that contributions **remain part of the free ecosystem** and that the project’s values are preserved.
