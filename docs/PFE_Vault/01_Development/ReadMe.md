### 🎯 Purpose

This section documents **how** you’re building the game:

- Dev Blogs
- Roadmaps
- Build notes
- Tools & workflows

This is where you track the **meta-layer of development** — your journey, updates, and infrastructure.

### 🧠 What Goes Here

- DevBlogs (like a development diary)
- Roadmaps and milestone planning
- Patch/build release notes
- Notes on development tools (Unity setup, Git, version control)

### 🔗 Connections

- References systems in `02_Design` (to document how they’re built)
- Uses `05_Tasks` for actionable work
- Connects to guides in `03_Guides` (for onboarding collaborators)

### 🧰 Best Practices

- Start each day or week with a **DevLog entry**. It builds a history.
- Use tags like `#devlog`, `#update`, `#roadmap` for Dataview filtering.
- Treat this like a **behind-the-scenes journal** for yourself and future teammates.

### 📝 Example Notes

`# DevLog – 2025-10-16 Tags: #devlog #update ## Summary Worked on core player movement prototype. Refined ball physics and added early collision sounds. ## Next - Add stamina drain to sprinting - Test shooting curve ## Reflections Feels smoother already. Might tweak friction constants.`
