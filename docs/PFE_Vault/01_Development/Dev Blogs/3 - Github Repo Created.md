## 🏟️ Overview
*A short paragraph summarizing the blog post.*  

Completed what I believe is most of what is needed from the Github Repo to begin working on the game itself. Further improvements can be done, such as finishing ReadMe, but the juice of the Github is completed. I also completed setting up a brand new Github Project and connecting Rust to it via GDExtensions. Took a lot of debugging to get it working.

## ⚽ Features / Updates
*List the new features, updates, or fixes. Include visuals if possible.*

- Corrected structure of folders in Github
- Corrected Links in ReadMe to actually point to files inside repo
- Finished the Contributing File
- Got more of the Repo ReadMe done. 
- Created a new Godot Project, as well as updating Godot and Rust to latest versions
- Updated my VSCode and extensions (some were deprecated)
- Verified I want to pursue project with Godot and Rust, decided on included GDScript so many more people can contribute quickly and prototyping is much quicker. Rust remains important for heavy computation and future proofing code
- Set up Rust working with the Godot project.
- Correctly set up .gitignore file, reducing size of repo from binaries in the Rust folders
- Uploaded all these changes to the Github Repo

## 🛠️ Technical Details
*Explain what was implemented, languages/tools used, and challenges faced.*

- Rust was hard to set up with Godot. But got the GDExtension file correct now, folder structure correct, and ensure the dependencies are correct. 
- Figuring out what to omit from repo was a little hard, but Godot thankfully has a default one included in their repo and Rust was mainly avoiding the target folder with the binaries to go to repo
