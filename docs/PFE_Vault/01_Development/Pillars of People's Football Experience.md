## **1. Free to Play**

### Free to all players

This game will be free to all players. This was done to hopefully ensure that all players can access the game regardless of their financial standing. Free means that anyone in the world can download the game and play it. 

### Free Updates and Future Games

The game will be updated regularly and any future installations will also be free. No more of the expensive yearly release that sports games are infamous for, these games will be free forever with a focus on quality over quantity.

### No ADs

There will be no in-game advertisements. Any advertisements in-game, such as stadium advertising banners or football kit sponsorships, will all be from fake in-universe companies.  

### No In-Game Purchases

There will be no form of in-game purchases.  This also means there will be NO PAY-TO-WIN in the game at all. This game is meant to be fair to all players so no player will gain an advantage based on how much money they have to spare.

## **2. Open Source**
### Openly Available Source Code

The game’s source code will be publicly available under the GNU General Public License v3.0. 

### Collaboration and Contribution

By being open source, this allows everyone to help contribute to this game. If you love football, you are more than welcome to help contribute to this game. You don't even need to be able to code. Any music, art, football kits, stadium designing, world building, or even data collection is encouraged. The aim is for everyone who loves football to help contribute to make this game the best it can be. In essence, anyone who makes a contribution helps make the game BETTER FOR EVERYONE. To learn how to contribute, please read over our Contributing Guidelines

### Learning and Education

Open Source means that anyone can take this time to LEARN more about Godot, Rust, coding, art, and Game Development as a whole. Even once the game is released, the game can still be a useful resource for other aspiring game designers to offshoot off this game and create their own football manager game.

### Longevity

Being Open Source also ensures that the game has more longevity outside of a gaming company. Company based games rely on that company to stay afloat which often translates to paywalls, in-game purchases, and subscription models. Since anyone and everyone can help make this game, this game doesn’t rely on one company to survive. As long as a small number of people, even one person, continues to work on this game - then this game can LIVE FOREVER

## **3. Fully Customizable**

### In-Game Customization

Unfortunately, the players and teams in the game will have to be fake due to licensing. But, this allows a GREATER RANGE OF FREEDOM. You, the player, will be allowed to edit and change anything about the footballing world. You can edit the territories, confederations, tournaments, teams, players, kits, stadiums, and even the managers. I aim to make everything in this game as editable from inside the game as possible.

For example, you can…..

1. Create a club with a custom logo, name, stats, players, manager, and even kits
2. Have Multiple Kits Per Team, allowing you to change kits yearly
3. Add a League Pyramid to a country that doesn’t have one in real life
4. Create Custom Tournaments in any country, confederation, and even across the world
5. Create custom territories like adding the Roman Empire, Mongolian Empire, or even past countries like Yugoslavia or USSR

and so much more….

The World of Football is truly up to you to customize and play around with

### Shareable Databases

While the In-Game editors will focus on changing small details (or even starting from scratch), it still would be a tedious task to create an entire new world in game. For that reason, there will be an in-game feature that can load in all the territories, confederations, teams, player, etc with the use of CSV files saved on your own computer. This allows players to create in-game databases that they can share with the world. This means you can write everything inside a csv file (such as Google Sheets) and, with a few clicks of a button, load an entire database into the game. Some examples of this includes

1. Downloading CSV Databases from other players
2. Sharing a Google Sheets with your friends to create your own custom world
3. A big content creator creating a Database in collaboration with their followers

### Mod Friendly

The open source nature allows any addition that the community wants to be added to the game. However, if an idea doesn’t align with the Pillars of the Game, then mods are a great way to get that custom experience and share it with the world. For that reason, and the fact that the game is open source, the game will attempt to be as mod friendly as can be

## **4. Inclusive and Accessible** 

### All Territories Included

For international football, this game aims to have every single territory on the planet. This includes all ~200 countries but also includes dependencies that have a strong football scene.

### More League Depth

Not only will every territory have a domestic league (if they have one in real life) but they will go as deep into the league pyramid as I can find. And with the help of individuals across the globe, these league pyramids can be made even deeper. Of course, the teams will be fake but follow the real life leagues as closely as can be

### Controller Support

While this game main focus is Mobile and PC, controller support is still very important to maintain. Not only does it expand the input options for the players, but it allows a new way to play the game. Controller Support also means that more accessible options such as using the Xbox Adaptive Controller is supported as well as Steam supported controller focused platforms like Steam Deck. This also means that console support may be a possibility in the future but it is currently not a major focus. IMPORTANT: Controller support is meant for gameplay for now

### Device Inclusivity

The ideal game is perfectly optimized to allow gameplay on Mobile as well. While not every type of phone may be supported, Mobile gameplay is still important as it expands the game to be playable by a wider audience. PC gameplay is also improved by a game optimized for Mobile performance as it opens the door for way more added features.

## **5. Single Player First**

While multiplayer may be an addition in the future, single player will always come first as a priority. Single player priority means the game has better longevity and control by the player.
