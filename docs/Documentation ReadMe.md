## ⚡ Getting Started with Obsidian

1. **Open Vault**  
   - Launch Obsidian and select `Open folder as vault`.
   - Choose the `PFE Vault/` folder as your vault.

2. **Navigation & Linking**  
   - Use Obsidian’s **backlinks** and **graph view** to see how notes connect.  
   - Internal links (`[[Note Name]]`) let you jump instantly between related topics.

3. **Tagging System**  
   - Tags (e.g., `#gameplay`, `#AI`, `#tutorial`) help categorize content across folders.  
   - Benefits:
     - Quickly find related notes regardless of folder location.
     - Filter your notes by type or theme in search and graph view.
     - Keep track of ongoing features, bugs, or ideas with consistent labels.

4. **Search & Metadata**  
   - Use Obsidian’s search to find players, mechanics, or code references instantly.  
   - Optional: add YAML frontmatter to notes for metadata like `status: draft` or `priority: high`.

## 🌐 Structure and Organization

The vault is organized for clarity and ease of navigation:

0. **Inbox**:       For brainstorming ideas and random notes
1. **Development**: Track the meta-layer of development
2. **Design**:      It’s where ideas become features and features become systems.
3. **Guides**:      To **teach** and **inform** — this is your documentation for players, testers, and collaborators.
4. **Wiki**:        The **in-universe** section of your vault — everything that exists inside the world of PFE
5. **Tasks**:       It’s where you track what’s being worked on, who’s doing it, and what’s next.
6. **Assets**:      Not for storing actual media, but for documenting how things should look, sound, and feel.

> Note: Tags and links allow you to cross-reference content across all folders without losing context.
